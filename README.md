# Movie Lister

Movie Lister gives you a random list of movies of which you can like, dislike, or even search for movie that you'd want. Clicking on each movie gives you the description as well as a popularity rating. Liking each movie will give a gold halo around the card, indicating it has been liked and conversely disliking the movie will remove the movie altogether from the list. Clicking the Movie Lister logo will give a fresh set of random movies in random quantities.
